The Thesis Abstract is written here (and kept just one page long or less). The page is kept centered vertically so can expand into the blank space above the title too\ldots Briefly, write in 3-4 paragraphs on what your project is about. This is a more precise version of your project abstract submitted on week 1 updated with developments between then and the submission time. Try to include the main features and functional requirements provided. As the title suggests this section is normally the only thing an executive would read so it MUST get across the main elements of the project.
