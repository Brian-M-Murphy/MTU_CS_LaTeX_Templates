\lhead{\emph{Discussion and Conclusions}}
Write a critical evaluation of your work. You should state your goals and research questions again and outline in short how they were or were not met or answered. What have you achieved? What more could have been accomplished? Mention any problems that affected the progress of your work. Is there any scope for extension/improvement/scalability? What are the new challenges to be faced in the future? The expectation here is that you should discuss the results presented in the previous evaluation section of the project in their totality (i.e. as a whole) from which you will then draw clear conclusions both on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the overall project. The conclusion section of this chapter should conclude the project.

\section{Discussion}
Discuss how well your solution solves the problem, based on your results from the evaluation chapter. Discuss how well you addressed the project, and what you might do differently if you were to do it again. Make sure to identify how you handled any problems that arose during the project.

\section{Conclusion}
Enumerate the main conclusions you have got in terms of background, problem description and the solution approach you have come up with. Detail your primary and any secondary conclusions from your project.

\section{Future Work}
Discuss any proposals for completion of the project, or for enhancements, or for re-design of your solution or software. Enumerate all the things you would have wanted to do should you have more time to work on this project.
