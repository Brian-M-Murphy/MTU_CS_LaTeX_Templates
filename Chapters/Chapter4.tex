\lhead{\emph{Project Implementation}}
This chapter should include the most relevant/important code listing and discuss relevant/interesting aspects; explain features you wish to highlight. 

\section{Important Features}
For each aspect you could provide the following info:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Description of the difficulty: Brief description of the problem you found.
    \item How did it affect the original project design?: Indicate how this difficulty affected:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the architecture of your solution
        \item if it represented a risk to your overall project (i.e. was it a FR)
        \item if it affected your methodology to develop your project (i.e. did developing this aspect change the design)
        \item if it changed your implementation schedule (i.e. did it delay other items)
        \item if it changed the evaluation plan (i.e. was more/less testing now required?)
    \item If there is complex code/configuration details discuss it here also.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

From January to May you will be developing your project. Along the way you will have encountered difficulties which might have modified your original plan so that you can come up with an actual developed project. You can discuss some of these that led to significant changes (if they exist). It is important here is that there is a clear rationale for design and implementation decisions made.
